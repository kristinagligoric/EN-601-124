    <h3 id="project">Why this workload?</h3>
    <p>
        The workload in this course is designed to support continued engagement with complex ethical issues. Short weekly reflections and periodic low-stakes quizzes are intended to encourage preparation and ongoing reflection rather than high-pressure performance. These assignments are graded only for completion, to promote consistency and discussion. Deeper evaluation is concentrated in the midterm and the group project.
