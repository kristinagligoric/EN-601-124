    <h3><b>Format Overview</b></h3>
    <p>
        There will be student-driven discussion and critique sessions in which we go over and discuss selected papers in
        each area. For each paper, ~two students will be assigned to write a review describing the 'pros' and 'cons' of
        the paper, and they will present their critique during the discussion.

    <h3><b>Evaluation and Format Details</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>One assignment (10%)</b> -- <i>individually</i>: The course has ONE assignment to measure your
            understanding of the foundational
            concepts of self-supervised learning. This is to make sure that when coming in, you know all the
            pre-requisites needed for the class. They will be released on this website, and submissions should be
            uploaded to Gradescope.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Submission:</b>The assignment must be submitted through Gradescope.</li>
                <li><b>Regrading:</b> Regrade requests can be submitted directly within Gradescope and must include a
                    brief written justification
                    for the request.
                </li>
                <li><b>Late days:</b> There are no late days for the one homework assignment.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>In-class participation (20%)</b> -- <i>individually</i>. This includes engagement and punctuality
            (being present in class before the presentation starts).
            It is important that you attend each session, complete the readings prior to class to participate in the
            discussions during the class.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Step Up/Step Back:</b>
                    This means, if you are the person who feels very comfortable sharing, take note of how often you are
                    sharing, and consider giving time for others to share (make sure to not monopolize the class time).
                    By all means, be present and active in this conversation, but make sure others have the time to as
                    well. If you tend to be a quiet participant, take a chance and "step up" with your idea, share your
                    concerns, your ideas, concerns, and excitement with the group. A good facilitator will make sure
                    this is safe for you.
                </li>
                <li><b>Punctuality:</b> We expect you to arrive before the presentations start.
                    Late arrivals will negatively impact your participation grade.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>One-page summary and presentation (20%)</b> -- <i>individually</i>.
            One-page summaries are meant to be mechanism to force us to think about what learned during the class.
            <ul>
                <li><b>After the class:</b> After each class, each student will write a "one-pager" summary of what this
                    class was about and what they learned (due the night before the class). They should organize it so
                    that one can quicky see the main takeaways.
                </li>
                <li><b>Beginning of the class:</b> At the beginning of each class, one of the students (randomly
                    selected) will remind us what we talked about in the previous class based on their one-pager.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Student-led paper presentation and critique (20%)</b> -- <i>in group</i>.
            This includes presenting papers assigned to you.
            Most class will involve a ~30-minute presentation by a team of 2-3 students about 1-2 assigned papers.
            The teams/paper assignments will be communicated at least 10 days ahead of the presentation.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Slide feedback:</b> The presenting team must share their slides ahead of time with the course
                    staff 48
                    hours before the presentation (Slack channel: #presentation-feedback). We will review the slides and
                    provide feedback about its content.
                </li>
                <li><b>Late days:</b> There are no late days for paper presentations. You cannot miss your presentation
                    day. If you can't make it, you're responsible for communicating it well in advance (>2 weeks
                    earlier).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>The course project (30%)</b> -- <i>teams or individually</i>. See the paragraph below for details</li>

        <li><b>Skip days:</b> You may skip up to 3 classes (during the dates that you're not presenting) with instructor
            consent ahead of time.
        </li>
    </ul>
