                <b>Course Conduct</b> This is a class focused on controversial topics. All students are expected to respect everyone's perspective and input and to contribute towards creating a welcoming and inclusive climate. We the instructors will strive to make this classroom an inclusive space for all students, and we welcome feedback on ways to improve.
            </p>

                <b> Academic Integrity Code </b> This course will have <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-programs/academic-integrity-code/">a zero-tolerance philosophy regarding plagiarism</a> or other forms of cheating, and incidents of academic dishonesty will be reported. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to this course should obtain specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the respective assignment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b> AI use</b> Assignments that are in large part quoted from an AI
                assistant are very unlikely to be evaluated positively. In addition, if a student's work is
                substantially identical to another student's work, that will be grounds for an investigation
                of plagiarism regardless of whether the text was produced by an AI assistant. You may not submit text or answers that were generated by AI systems as your own work.  

                Having said that, you may use AI tools as a learning aid. Acceptable uses include asking for explanations of concepts or terms that appear in readings, getting high-level feedback on how to improve a project or argument, brainstorming ideas, or receiving help with grammar and clarity in text you have written yourself. These tools should support your understanding and revision process, not replace your own thinking, analysis, or authorship. When in doubt about whether a particular use is allowed, ask the instructor before submitting your work.
