                Cheating is wrong. Cheating hurts our community by undermining academic
                integrity, creating mistrust, and fostering unfair competition. The university will
                punish cheaters with failure on an assignment, failure in a course, permanent
                transcript notation, suspension, and/or expulsion. Offenses may be reported to
                medical, law or other professional or graduate schools when a cheater applies.
                Violations can include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments without
                permission, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices, unauthorized
                collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery and falsification, lying,
                facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair competition. Ignorance of these rules
                is not an excuse.

                Academic honesty is required in all work you submit to be graded. Except where
                the instructor specifies group work, you must solve all homework and programming
                assignments without the help of others. For example, you must not look at anyone
                else's solutions (including program code) to your homework problems. However,
                you may discuss assignment specifications (not solutions) with others to be sure
                you understand what is required by the assignment.
                If your instructor permits using fragments of source code from outside sources, such
                as your textbook or on-line resources, you must properly cite the source. Not citing
                it constitutes plagiarism. Similarly, your group projects must list everyone who
                participated.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the above paragraph "outside sources" also include content that was produced by an AI assistant
                like ChatGPT.
                This follows either by treating the AI assistant as a person for the purposes of this policy
                (controversial) or acknowledging that the AI assistant was trained directly on people's original work.
                Thus, while you are not forbidden from using these tools, you should consider the above policy
                carefully and quote where appropriate. Assignments that are in large part quoted from an AI
                assistant are very unlikely to be evaluated positively. In addition, if a student's work is
                substantially identical to another student's work, that will be grounds for an investigation
                of plagiarism regardless of whether the prose was produced by an AI assistant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Falsifying program output or results is prohibited.
                Your instructor is free to override parts of this policy for particular assignments. To
                protect yourself: (1) Ask the instructor if you are not sure what is permissible. (2)
                Seek help from the instructor, TA or CAs, as you are always encouraged to do,
                rather than from other students. (3) Cite any questionable sources of help you may
                have received.
